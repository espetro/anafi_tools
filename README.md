> The simulator is built in such a way that it generates a simulated en-vironment, which must be defined following a strict format in a text file,and which is specified when the simulator is launched.  During the simu-lation an output text file is generated each time the simulation is updated,which happens at a frequency of 30Hz.  The directory where the output ofthe simulator is stored must be specified when it is launched.  The simula-tion ends when the condition that ends the simulation (explained below) ismet.  Thus, the information generated by a single run of the simulator fora given environment is a directory with as much output files as simulatediterations. Each output file contains the position of all the objects in the en-vironment so that it is possible to compute any distance between any pairof objects, and consequently any interaction force.
